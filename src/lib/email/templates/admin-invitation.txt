Hi {{firstName}},

You have been invited to become an administrator for The Suite app.

Next steps:
1. Check your inbox for a separate email from The Suite with the subject "Set your password" or "Reset your password".
2. Follow the instructions in that email to set your password and activate your admin account.
3. After setting your password, you will be able to log in and access the admin dashboard.

If you did not expect this invitation, you can safely ignore this email.

Best regards,
The Suite Team
